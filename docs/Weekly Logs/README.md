The home for personal and team weekly logs.  

Please follow the required structure for the logs. Please create the required structure for each team member (i.e. create a named folder for your personal logs).  For personal logs, each team member can have one markdown file that incorporates added content with the appropriate dates each week. For team logs, each week should correspond to a separate file (markdown or PDF).
