### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
As we moved frward from the last cycle , a large portion of my due taaks were completed , approved and merged into the development branch. I added the feature of downloading the exam and course results as a csv file for the instructor as well as the instructor dashboard functionality has been improved with the help of adding the checkboxes and delete/archive button which were further worked on to make it functional. The 5 point summary analysis plots the data on a box plot perfectly and in a detailed manner. This cycle I completely revamped the student view and design, it has now been given a new and consistent look as well as the courses and the exam for that particular student are displayed. I further picked up on the minor details and features left for the system as major portion has been done by us as a team. I will be moving forward towards the next cycle working on the UI changes as those are our main goals for the week.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- User Story: Enhance Course and Exam Management #207
- User Story: Enhance Exam Stastics and Grade Edit #243
- User Story: Improve Instructor User Interface and Experience #241

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Since I moved ahead from the last cycle, it was planned to get the PR approved and merged after the long work of revamping the application using shad cn with all the major components revamped and integrated well , and the little details for the same will be revisited later as and when we make some noticeable changes. Hence, the PR was approved which closed issues #80 #206 and #207, and was merged for the team members to work ahead on the related components. Over the weekend , I created a new component which fetched the dats from the backend and displays the exam details for each of them , seperately. I created a PR for the same which is in review and needs some related changes after the authO PR being merged. I have also added the functionality for the instructor to export the results for the course and the exam as a CSV. I started working on the five point number analysis for the instructor for each exam as well, for which the backend call needs a little fix which wont be taking long. Additionally , the frontend for the student dashboard is done as for now , will be working on the backend as I move forward towards the next cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- User Story: Enhance Course and Exam Management #207
- User Story: Download Results #18
- Revamp Student Dashboard - to display the courses and the exams for each student individually
- 5-point summary analysis for the instructor

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
As I moved forward from the last cycle, I completed all the majorly required pages for the Instructor but since we got the OMR processing working, I completely revamped the pages for them as well to give it a enhanced look. I did some work on the student dashboard as well, revamping it completely to give it a new look. I managed to fix some testing for the frontend compoenents after doing work on the instructor pages but there are still a few to do. I am very happy with the work I did for the new UI design of the application and how the process is going altogether. Moving forward , I will be trying to make a PR over the weekend to get the completed UI changes merged into development branch before moving further with new UI changes. I will also be making progress with the student dashboard to get it almost done over the weekend, and moving forward will try to make a PR for the same as well before the next cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Revamping the front end completely UI using Shad cn - also modifying the related frontend tests due to new components added/create new tests, if needed
- User Story: Optimize User Interface and Usability
- User Story: Enhance Navigation and Consistency
- User Story: Improve Dashboard Functionality #206

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I have made a good progress on updating the instructor view , after keeping in mind the reviews and comments received during the peer review - first round , and pages with a lot of new shad cn components, a review for the same is required to list down some final changes and minute details we want to add to the same. There still some of the componeents still under progress which should be finalised and completed byt the next cycle, hopefully. The rpocess of revamping is a bit time consuming as the complete layout and design with new componenets being added is changed, but its been a good progress. Now the next major task would be to get completed with the remaining components still under progress and move to modify the exisiting frontend tests and create the new tests as needed. The student view would then be created in the following week which would be a little less complex than the instructor view.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Revamping the front end completely UI using Shad cn - also modifying the related frontend tests due to new components added/create new tests, if needed
- User Story: Optimize User Interface and Usability
- User Story: Enhance Navigation and Consistency
- User Story: Improve Dashboard Functionality #206

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I successfully completed the logic for the graphs visible on the Instructor dashboard for data visualization. Now they correctly display the resukts and the graph as required and needed. After being partially done with the revamp of the Dahsboard , I managed to create an interactive sidebar which was a great UI addition to our application. The instructor pages have been edited and revamped here and there but there are soe changes needed. The process of revamping would take a little long as we are giving it a complete new look. I will also be editing/writing new tests if needed in order to get everything tested after while the process of revamp goes on. The plan of the next cycle is to mainly go over the instructior pages to make some final changes as needed so that the Student pages can be succesfully revamoed in the following cycle.


### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Revamping the front end completely UI using Shad cn 
- Editing/Creating new front end tests if needed after during the process of revamping

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
Moving forward from the last cycle, we succesfully completed the process of revamping the Dashboard partially. There are some changes here and there which now wont be taking long duration of time for the Dashboard as the major components have been changed by myself and Omar. The main time was consumed in changing each and every individual components and the addition of the icons as well. I have successfully completed the testing for the Student Grade Report feature. For the upcoming cycle, I will be completing the dashboard using shad cn and also all the other pages for our application along with the related testing to make sure it passes the newly created as well as the existing tests. I have to also look up the graphs logic in order to put in values in our database for one more course so that the graphs are rendered for both the courses as per our requirements and show the correct data.


### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Revamping the front end UI using Shad cn 
- Debugging graphs logic - Instructor Dashboard

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
After the last cycle, I took up on starting working on revamping the Dashboard using shad cn first as we were facing some issues with the installations and the related depenedencies. There are still some issues in the installations here and there for shad cn and their related components that needs to be fixed and is cauisng a little hindrance in the revamp procedure. I completed the front end test for the student grade report created in the last cycle. The backend test for the same took a back seat since the shad cn installation and error fixing took a major amount of time. We aim to get the errors for the same fixed first , and then moving ahead to hopefully go through a smooth revamp process.

- Revamping the front end UI using Shad cn

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
For this cycle as I completed the Data Visualisation for the instructor , I took up on writing tests for the same both frontend and backend. I made sure it passes all the existing tests and the new tests do not break or fail any of the existing tests. Moving forward , I worked on the student grade report , which retrieved data from the backend as well since till the last cycle it was only the UI changes for the same. I stopped working further on the student grade report as we first wanted to get started with revamping the application using shad cn, so I took up on the task of revamping the same. For the next cycle, I will try to be working on revamping extensively and writing the related tests for the same and make an effort to simulataneously work on the grade report as well. Coming to the task of revamping the UI, with the help of Omar, we got the set up ready with the necessary installations for the same and I started off by working on the Instructor Dashboard components.

- Grade Report for students - with testing

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
As moving forward from the last cycle , I completed the PR for the data visualization user story after getting a quick fix help from Nelson as well, to display the graphs for the instructor to get better results for performance insights. I decided to then take up on changing the grade report layout for the student as decided by the team together. I did the front end changes for the same and made a PR to get the layout approved by the team memebers and then moving forward after approval I will be working on retrieving the desired data from the back end. Side by side working on revamping the dashboard as well.


### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Grade Report for students - Backend retrieval of data
- User story : Student Result Viewing Options
- Enhancing the front end UI using Shad cn - to be complete by the next cycle

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
After getting back on track after the missed work due to the final, I managed to complete the data visualization issue to make charts on the instructor dashboard to get performance insights and my PR for the same is under progress as I write and submit this log. Now , I will be taking over the grade report to be created for the students using charts for the courses enrolled. While I was working on revamping the dashboard, I ai to first complete the assigned issues and features that need to be completed for the MVP mini presentation.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
After completing the dark mode feature for the system, I started making changes to the student dashboard continuing from last cycle after learning from all the related documentation to revamp the look of the system using the shad cn components. Made the changes locally on my system to replace the styles and the components with shad cn but had some issues while installing the shad cn package and the related dependencies as it was not visible and running even though the package was installed. I aim to fix the same after the physics which wont take too long and start off with the data visualization tool to to be used for the system. I tried to manage as much work as I could during the cycle along with the final exam prep stress, but I am motivated to make up for as much missed.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Data Visualization #16 ( Startting off after some research on the same, to get perfromance insights on the student)
- Enhancing the front end UI using Shad cn - to be complete by the next cycle

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I have taken up and implemented the dark mode fetaure for our system, while I was working on revamping the student view and the dashboard using shad cn. I made some progress on the same by installing the required packages and making the chnages locally to get an understanding. I was determined to complete the same but, got distracted and completed the dark mode feature instead. I was not able to give as much as I wanted during this cycle as I have a final this week, but I aim to complete some part of the shad cn enhancement feature to start off with the data visualization,gradually, after the next cycle.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I took up on creating the user interface for the student view by using the already created html and css files previously by using React in order to create dynamic and responsive user design layout for students. I did some research for the front end testing for the student view to be implemented (which is in progress and will be completed by the next cycle). I have currently taken up on the user story:Data Visualization #16 and doing some research on the same and intend to start working on the same by the next cycle and witness some progress.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I successfully completed the mini presentation for the presentation to be held. I did some further research on testing so that the same can be performed after the codes for the features have been generated. I plan to go over the tech stack over the weekend and take up some more backend tasks for future development of the features as I wish to do much more than what I was able to for the development of the system. The process is going very smoothly as a team.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Implement tests for HTML/CSS
- Intend to take up more backend tasks for more features to be implemented

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I managed to help with the creation of the instructor view pages including the formatting of the same. I successfully created the html and css files for the student view of the system including all the formatting and styles required to make the front end efficient and follows the design created in the UI mockup. Then, I managed to create a combined CSS file for the student view containing all the styles for the student for the team to review so that a consolidated css file can be created for both , the instructor and the student view. Now, I will start with the testing of the codes using Selenium along with some help in  reactifying the UI if needed by the team. I wanted to start the testing earlier during the week, but due to other course midterms got delayed but I gained some insightful knowledge on testing frameworks in order to kick start the same during the next cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Run some Tests for the codes generate and create test report (using Selenium)
- Implement tests for HTML/CSS
- Updating/Reviewing the presentation slides for Friday (Team Review)

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I managed to help with the creation of the instructor view pages including the formatting of the same. I successfully created the html and css files for the student view of the system including all the formatting and styles required to make the front end efficient and follows the design created in the UI mockup. Then, I managed to create a combined CSS file for the student view containing all the styles for the student for the team to review so that a consolidated css file can be created for both , the instructor and the student view. Now, I will start with the testing of the codes using Selenium along with some help in  reactifying the UI if needed by the team. I wanted to start the testing earlier during the week, but due to other course midterms got delayed but I gained some insightful knowledge on testing frameworks in order to kick start the same during the next cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Run some Tests for the codes generate and create test report (using Selenium)
- Implement tests for HTML/CSS
- Updating/Reviewing the presentation slides for Friday (Team Review)
