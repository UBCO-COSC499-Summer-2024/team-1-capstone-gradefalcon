### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I successfully completed the mini presentation for the presentation to be held. I did some further research on testing so that the same can be performed after the codes for the features have been generated. I plan to go over the tech stack over the weekend and take up some more backend tasks for future development of the features as I wish to do much more than what I was able to for the development of the system. The process is going very smoothly as a team.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Implement tests for HTML/CSS
- Intend to take up more backend tasks for more features to be implemented

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I managed to help with the creation of the instructor view pages including the formatting of the same. I successfully created the html and css files for the student view of the system including all the formatting and styles required to make the front end efficient and follows the design created in the UI mockup. Then, I managed to create a combined CSS file for the student view containing all the styles for the student for the team to review so that a consolidated css file can be created for both , the instructor and the student view. Now, I will start with the testing of the codes using Selenium along with some help in  reactifying the UI if needed by the team. I wanted to start the testing earlier during the week, but due to other course midterms got delayed but I gained some insightful knowledge on testing frameworks in order to kick start the same during the next cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Run some Tests for the codes generate and create test report (using Selenium)
- Implement tests for HTML/CSS
- Updating/Reviewing the presentation slides for Friday (Team Review)
