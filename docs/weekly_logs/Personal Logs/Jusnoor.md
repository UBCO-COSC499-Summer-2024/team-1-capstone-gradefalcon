### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
As moving forward from the last cycle , I completed the PR for the data visualization user story after getting a quick fix help from Nelson as well, to display the graphs for the instructor to get better results for performance insights. I decided to then take up on changing the grade report layout for the student as decided by the team together. I did the front end changes for the same and made a PR to get the layout approved by the team memebers and then moving forward after approval I will be working on retrieving the desired data from the back end. Side by side working on revamping the dashboard as well.


### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Grade Report for students - Backend retrieval of data
- User story : Student Result Viewing Options
- Enhancing the front end UI using Shad cn - to be complete by the next cycle

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
After getting back on track after the missed work due to the final, I managed to complete the data visualization issue to make charts on the instructor dashboard to get performance insights and my PR for the same is under progress as I write and submit this log. Now , I will be taking over the grade report to be created for the students using charts for the courses enrolled. While I was working on revamping the dashboard, I ai to first complete the assigned issues and features that need to be completed for the MVP mini presentation.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
After completing the dark mode feature for the system, I started making changes to the student dashboard continuing from last cycle after learning from all the related documentation to revamp the look of the system using the shad cn components. Made the changes locally on my system to replace the styles and the components with shad cn but had some issues while installing the shad cn package and the related dependencies as it was not visible and running even though the package was installed. I aim to fix the same after the physics which wont take too long and start off with the data visualization tool to to be used for the system. I tried to manage as much work as I could during the cycle along with the final exam prep stress, but I am motivated to make up for as much missed.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Data Visualization #16 ( Startting off after some research on the same, to get perfromance insights on the student)
- Enhancing the front end UI using Shad cn - to be complete by the next cycle

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I have taken up and implemented the dark mode fetaure for our system, while I was working on revamping the student view and the dashboard using shad cn. I made some progress on the same by installing the required packages and making the chnages locally to get an understanding. I was determined to complete the same but, got distracted and completed the dark mode feature instead. I was not able to give as much as I wanted during this cycle as I have a final this week, but I aim to complete some part of the shad cn enhancement feature to start off with the data visualization,gradually, after the next cycle.

- Enhancing the front end UI using Shad cn - to be complete by the next cycle

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I took up on creating the user interface for the student view by using the already created html and css files previously by using React in order to create dynamic and responsive user design layout for students. I did some research for the front end testing for the student view to be implemented (which is in progress and will be completed by the next cycle). I have currently taken up on the user story:Data Visualization #16 and doing some research on the same and intend to start working on the same by the next cycle and witness some progress.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I successfully completed the mini presentation for the presentation to be held. I did some further research on testing so that the same can be performed after the codes for the features have been generated. I plan to go over the tech stack over the weekend and take up some more backend tasks for future development of the features as I wish to do much more than what I was able to for the development of the system. The process is going very smoothly as a team.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Implement tests for HTML/CSS
- Intend to take up more backend tasks for more features to be implemented

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I managed to help with the creation of the instructor view pages including the formatting of the same. I successfully created the html and css files for the student view of the system including all the formatting and styles required to make the front end efficient and follows the design created in the UI mockup. Then, I managed to create a combined CSS file for the student view containing all the styles for the student for the team to review so that a consolidated css file can be created for both , the instructor and the student view. Now, I will start with the testing of the codes using Selenium along with some help in  reactifying the UI if needed by the team. I wanted to start the testing earlier during the week, but due to other course midterms got delayed but I gained some insightful knowledge on testing frameworks in order to kick start the same during the next cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Run some Tests for the codes generate and create test report (using Selenium)
- Implement tests for HTML/CSS
- Updating/Reviewing the presentation slides for Friday (Team Review)

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I managed to help with the creation of the instructor view pages including the formatting of the same. I successfully created the html and css files for the student view of the system including all the formatting and styles required to make the front end efficient and follows the design created in the UI mockup. Then, I managed to create a combined CSS file for the student view containing all the styles for the student for the team to review so that a consolidated css file can be created for both , the instructor and the student view. Now, I will start with the testing of the codes using Selenium along with some help in  reactifying the UI if needed by the team. I wanted to start the testing earlier during the week, but due to other course midterms got delayed but I gained some insightful knowledge on testing frameworks in order to kick start the same during the next cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals ( What to accomplish during the next cycle ):
- Run some Tests for the codes generate and create test report (using Selenium)
- Implement tests for HTML/CSS
- Updating/Reviewing the presentation slides for Friday (Team Review)
