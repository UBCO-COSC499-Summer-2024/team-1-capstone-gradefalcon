### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
  * Began aditional research on how to run backend testing, diverted attention to fix frontend tests that broke due to implimentation of exam creation, It was nessesary to change focus due so some the branch with the implimention of exam control could be merged.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Divert my focus back to to backend testing, planning on having either all tests for any backend features currently implimented to the dev branch completed.

    </tr>
</table>

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
task 1: Only a few tests were ready for fridays presentation and jest required imeanse initial configuration in order to handle the project conventions, after the presentation I reworked the jest configuration so outdated dependancies would no longer be used

task 2: Researched how to impliment backend testing on react and how to tie it to pages which has processing nested in frontend pages, (to begin coding on wednessday morning before the meeting and ideally have one good backend test file before the meeting), once an initial good/quality test file is created as an example, test files will be generated for every feature

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Create backend testing for all features existing before backend tests are implimented
  * What additional features to work on will be decided after my two finals on (06/24->25), I disclosed this to the group and garanteed that I will more than make up for any missed work.

</table>

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
task 1: Reactying HTML/CSS took longer than excpected to adapt due to a lack of familiararity aswell as some previously nested javascript needing to be adapted outside of the HTML. The CSS also messed up visual alignmnents so that had resulted in some nessesary micro adjustments

task 2: Begand researching frontend testing and decided on jest and learned how to do it, discussion and planning about testing friday's 3 features delayed any tests being produced for the frontend

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * cleaning up remaining visual issues resulting from porting the HTML/CSS ui over to react (which a few pages still need to be adapted to incompadability errors)
  * frontend testing with jest
  * feature unit tests with jest/react testing
