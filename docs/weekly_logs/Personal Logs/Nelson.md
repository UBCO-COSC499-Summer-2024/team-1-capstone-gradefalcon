### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
In this cycle, I was able to regain momentum after a busy start to the week. My primary focus was on setting up Drone CI. Initially, I managed to configure it locally, but upon further consideration of the project's future and after reading feedback from other teams using Drone, I decided to conduct additional research to ensure we are implementing the best solution efficiently. I determined that setting up a remote server on a cloud provider for Drone would be more scalable and beneficial for our project. This aligns with our plan to use a cloud provider for managing exam PDF file storage. I have made significant progress in setting up this remote server during this cycle.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Set Up Remote server
  * Set up Cloud Provider
  * Set up Drone
  * Finish adding functionality for Admin View
  * Research the best more about computer vision and OMR

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
This cycle was a litte more challenging than the rest because I had to take care of some personal issues that needed my attention, I likely feel like I was able to handle it very well and was still able to do a little bit of work. The main object was to redesign the signup/login page to allow role based authenication, and to also allow admins to create and add users to the system and maanage users. Now I that it is working I am working on connecting the CI/CD. I also did a little bit of research to increase my knowledge.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Gte CI/CD connected and working.
  * Finishe adding functionality for Admin View
  * Research the best more about computer vision and OMR

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
This cycle felt much longer than the rest I faced quite a few challenges with the technologies we were using mainly because I did not understand the technologies as well as I thought. I was struggling quite a bit with docker and express especially when it came to connecting to the database and making queries to and from. I think it was really challenging because of how complex postgre is. Thankyfully my teammates were able to help me out and were patient with me. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Backend API making sure express is fully functional with the rest of the pages.
  * Create a little demo bubble sheet scanner to demo idea's.
  * Research the best place to store the pdf's either locally or the cloud and create a little demo.

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I managed to create the intial mockup for the login and sigup page using html and css for my team to review and now I have completed reformating the code to makee sure it abides by our design architecture guidelines about it being done in react with the use of express for routing. Now I am working to connecting it to the database and writing the frontend validation neccessary for authentication. I would have like to have had all this completed by the beginning to this week but a very hetic weekend has led me to not get us much work done as I wanted. I did quite a lot of knowledge refreshment in the areas of react, express and postgre over the weekend to make use I have the knowledge required to put my ideas into action. I want to be more productive this week and in the weeks to come.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Backend API making sure express is fully functional with the rest of the pages.
  * Create a little demo bubble sheet scanner to demo idea's.
  * Making the frontend fully functional.
