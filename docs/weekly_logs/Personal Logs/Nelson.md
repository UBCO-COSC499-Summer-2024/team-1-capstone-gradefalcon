### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I managed to create the intial mockup for the login and sigup page using html and css for my team to review and now I have completed reformating the code to makee sure it abides by our design architecture guidelines about it being done in react with the use of express for routing. Now I am working to connecting it to the database and writing the frontend validation neccessary for authentication. I would have like to have had all this completed by the beginning to this week but a very hetic weekend has led me to not get us much work done as I wanted. I did quite a lot of knowledge refreshment in the areas of react, express and postgre over the weekend to make use I have the knowledge required to put my ideas into action. I want to be more productive this week and in the weeks to come.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Backend API making sure express is fully functional with the rest of the pages.
  * Create a little demo bubble sheet scanner to demo idea's.
  * Making the frontend fully functional.
