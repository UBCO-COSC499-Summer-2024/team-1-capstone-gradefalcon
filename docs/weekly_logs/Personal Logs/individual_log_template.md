### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
I completed Task A as planned, but Task B and C is taking longer than expected due to complexity in testing. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
  * Goal 1
  * Goal 2
  * Goal 3
