### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

### Summary
This cycle saw significant progress across the team despite personal and academic challenges. After the second round of peer review , we took the feedback seriously and made some issues accordingly. The issues and tasks were assigned as per the role of each of the members in the team to complete the tasks accordingly. Jusnoor continued to enhance the UI of the application to give it a clean and modern look by doing Color and Button Styling , making some layout adjustments, adding the necessary tooltips as required for easy navigation and user efficiency. Jusnoor also enhanced the Exam and Class Table Interactions by adding some icons and adjusting the back buttons along with fixing the redirection of pages. Jusnoor fixed the Student dashboard to give it a clean look and use the white space such that the exams are displayed with filter on them as per the courses in which each of the student is enrolled. Bennett succesfully completed the task of deleting/archiving the courses and the exams along with the related bug fixes which were faced during the process. Bennett also fixed the import class component of the new class form such that the imported class fits into the modal and does not overlfow. Omar and Ahmad collectively worked on the fnctional enhancements and the features related to OMR and grading which includes : If exam already graded, cannot regrade , Reaccess examkey,  + and - next to input field for marking scheme instead of over and Use spinner instead of loading circle, make OMR faster. Omar and Ankit also worked on the status and the feedback display to enhance the related UI as per the new changes made such as : UI Score in review exams pages to change and Change the stats display to 5 points statistics to have the line. Omar really brilliantly created a custom template which helps in making a custom bubble sheet and makes the process efficient and user friendly. Ahmad updated the View Exams and Review Exams page with the added features and recommendations as per the review for the UI and made some additions which made it consistent with the system and the procedure. Nelson successfully completed the student grade report feature such that the student can make reports for a grade to be changed and the same would be displayed to the instructor with the student details in order to nmake the process of updating the status of report easy. Moving forward towards the last cycle of the term , we aim to complete all the little UI changes left and succesfully close all the issues for the complete project as all our coure features are mostly complete with only a little fixes which would be done by the end of the next cycle.
