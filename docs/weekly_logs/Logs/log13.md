## Test Report / Testing Status:

During the last cycle, our team made substantial progress in testing, focusing on various aspects to ensure the robustness of our application. Here's a summary of the key testing activities we accomplished:

1. **Backend Testing:**
   - Completed the initial implementation of backend tests.
   - Created additional tests for new features.
   - Conducted comprehensive login testing, which highlighted the need for more thorough backend input verification across all functionalities.
   - Addressed several complexities and resolved errors that arose during backend testing.

2. **Frontend Testing:**
   - Implemented frontend tests for new UI components and functionalities.
   - Expanded existing frontend tests to cover additional user scenarios.
   - Utilized tools like Playwright for end-to-end testing to simulate real user interactions.

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Ensured that our tests integrated well with real database connections where applicable.
   - Used appropriate mocking techniques to maintain test quality and reliability.

4. **Efficiency Improvements:**
   - Identified areas where backend tests were incomplete and developed strategies to address these in future cycles.
   - Streamlined the testing process to enhance efficiency and reduce the time required for test execution and error resolution.

Overall, our efforts this cycle have strengthened our testing framework, providing a solid foundation for more efficient and comprehensive testing in the future. By the next cycle, we aim to ensure all features are thoroughly tested, maintaining high standards of quality and reliability.

## Overview:

**Current Overview:**

During this cycle, the team made significant strides in various areas of the project. Omar worked on parsing and confirming CSV from OMR, integrating the Flask service to trigger OMR processing on file upload, and refactoring the UI using Shadcn UI components. Nelson focused on implementing RBAC Passports, writing account settings with tests, and enhancing AWS file upload and download functionality. Bennett continued additional frontend testing, backend testing, and e2e testing, while Jusnoor worked on data visualization, enhancing the frontend UI using Shadcn components, and developing the student grade report with testing. Ahmad focused on using OMR to scan uploaded solution keys, allowing teachers to confirm solutions, and saving answers to the database. The team collectively focused on backend and frontend testing, achieving comprehensive test coverage for newly implemented features. Moving forward, the team aims to ensure seamless integration of the OMR with the backend and frontend, handle large file uploads efficiently, and maintain high standards of testing across all components.

**Individual Contributions:**

- **Omar**: Worked on parsing and confirming CSV from OMR, integrating Flask service to trigger OMR processing on file upload, and refactoring the UI using Shadcn UI components. He also focused on setting up the frontend to use Shadcn UI components and worked on debugging Proxy errors.
- **Nelson**: Implemented RBAC Passports, wrote account settings with tests, and enhanced AWS file upload and download functionality. He also addressed input verification and backend protections, such as brute force protection.
- **Bennett**: Continued additional frontend testing, backend testing, and e2e testing. He refactored tests to use mocking instead of real database calls, improving the robustness and efficiency of tests.
- **Jusnoor**: Worked on data visualization for instructors, enhancing the frontend UI using Shadcn components, and developing the student grade report with testing. He also addressed issues with Shadcn component installations and frontend testing for the student grade report.
- **Ahmad**: Focused on using OMR to scan uploaded solution keys, allowing teachers to confirm solutions, and saving answers to the database. He debugged issues related to the OMR and tested the entire upload exam solution key cycle.

**Next Steps:***

- Write comprehensive tests for all features.
- Implement a robust file storage system.
- Continue OMR model development and integration.
- Ensure seamless integration of the OMR with backend and frontend components.
- Maintain high standards of testing across all components.
- Complete Auth0 session management.
- Finalize data visualization for grade reports and instructor dashboards.
- Improve/Redesign UI using shadCN
