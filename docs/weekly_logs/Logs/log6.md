## Test Report / Testing Status:

N/A

## Overview:
 
We have succesfully ported the instructor and the stduent view to react. There have been tests implemented for the instructor view and the student view testing is in progress. The front end for the admin view has been created and the added functionality for the same is in progress. The student data validation feature has been implemeneted as there are two main users of the system, instructor and student. We can view the exam results as a student user as well as export the results as a CSV file too. There have been some test runs for the class management, and there is a added feature for the exam creation implemented into the system. As an overall view , ther ehave been some design reworks and related implementations for enhancement and there have been some back end tests in order to verify the implemented features.
