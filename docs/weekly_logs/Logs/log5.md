## Overview:
 
We have finished porting all HTML and CSS designs to React and have started implementing functionality on our pages, especially after fixing all errors occurring between Express and Postgres. We have also begun testing for features as we are implementing them, namely the dashboard and login/signup pages. Our next step is to allow teachers to schedule and create examinations, devise a file storage system and start developing our OMR model.
