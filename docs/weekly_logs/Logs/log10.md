## Test Report / Testing Status:

We have made significant progress in backend testing, completing the initial implementation and starting to create additional tests for new features. The login testing revealed the need for more thorough backend input verification across all features. Efficiency was a challenge this cycle, with some backend tests remaining incomplete due to difficulties in implementation and error resolution. However, this experience will help streamline future testing efforts. By the next cycle, we aim to ensure comprehensive testing for all implemented features, including frontend, backend, and end-to-end testing, using real database connections where applicable and appropriate mocking to maintain test quality.


## Overview:

### Current Overview

During this cycle, the team made significant progress across various aspects of the project. Bennett successfully completed login testing, which highlighted the need for more thorough backend input verification. Although efficiency was a challenge, this experience will streamline future backend tests. Omar achieved a successful integration of OMRChecker, containerization, and implemented PDF to image conversion, along with updates to the Dashboard and creation of an Upload Exams page. Jusnoor completed the data visualization for the instructor dashboard and is now focusing on creating grade reports for students using charts. Ahmad utilized Roboflow and YOLO for scanning and parsing bubble sheets, but shifted to manually calculating parameters to meet client requests, ensuring the OMR can scan existing UBC sheets. Nelson overcame challenges in setting up Drone CI on AWS, resolved network issues, and began creating storage space for 200-page PDF exams. The team is now focusing on integrating the OMR with the backend and frontend, handling large file uploads, and ensuring comprehensive testing for all features.

**Individual Contributions:**
- **Omar**: Created OMR Conatainer on Docker, training OMR, OMR Model.
- **Nelson**: Set up Drone CI on AWS Server, File Storage/Upload on AWS Server.
- **Jusnoor**: Enhancing UI and Data Visualization.
- **Bennett**: Implemented backend testing, fixed frontend tests.
- **Ahmad**: Progressed OMR model development using YOLOv3, addressing borderless scan issues.

**Next Steps:**
- Write Tests.
- Implement a robust file storage system.
- Continue OMR model development and integration.
- Complete Auth0 session management.
- Data Visualization
