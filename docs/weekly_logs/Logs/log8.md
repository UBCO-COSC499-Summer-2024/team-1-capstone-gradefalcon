## Test Report / Testing Status:

We have currrently implemented and continue to implement quite a bit of frontend testing we are also starting to work on backend testing. We have tests passing on the frontend which is good but with this in progress we found the need to get our CI/CD pipeline implemented and working using drone. It should be implemented by next cycle. 

## Overview:

We have finished porting all HTML and CSS designs to React and have started implementing functionality on our pages, especially after fixing all errors occurring between Express and PostgreSQL. We have also begun testing features as we implement them, focusing on the dashboard and login/signup pages. Our next step is to allow teachers to schedule and create examinations, devise a file storage system, and start developing our OMR model. We have brainstormed several ways to implement our OMR model and are beginning to work seriously on our visions. Additionally, we have restructured our folders to improve code maintainability for both the frontend and backend. Some of our members had final exams, so our time dedicated to this project was less compared to last week, but we expect to pick up the pace in the next cycle.
