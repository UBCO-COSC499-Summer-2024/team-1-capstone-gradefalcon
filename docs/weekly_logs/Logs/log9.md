## Test Report / Testing Status:

We have currrently implemented and continue to implement quite a bit of frontend testing we are also starting to work on backend testing. We have tests passing on the frontend which is good but with this in progress we found the need to get our CI/CD pipeline implemented and working using drone. It should be implemented by next cycle. 

## Overview:

### Current Overview

We have completed porting all HTML and CSS designs to React and have started implementing functionality on our pages, resolving all errors between Express and PostgreSQL. We have also begun testing features, focusing on the dashboard and login/signup pages. Key progress includes restructuring our folders for better maintainability, continuing work on Auth0 integration, and finalizing new exam functionalities. 

**Individual Contributions:**
- **Omar**: Finalized refactored file structure, implemented new exam functionality, continued Auth0 integration, and researched new OMR container.
- **Nelson**: Set up Drone CI locally and started configuring a remote server for better scalability.
- **Jusnoor**: Completed dark mode, revamped student dashboard using Shadcn components, and prepared for data visualization.
- **Bennett**: Researched backend testing, fixed frontend tests.
- **Ahmad**: Began OMR model development using YOLOv3, addressing borderless scan issues.

**Next Steps:**
- Allow teachers to schedule and create exams.
- Implement a robust file storage system.
- Continue OMR model development and integration.
- Complete Auth0 session management.
