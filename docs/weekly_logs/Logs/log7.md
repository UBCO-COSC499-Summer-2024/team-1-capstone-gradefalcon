## Test Report / Testing Status:
We have run some front end testing in order to test the front end development of the instructor view. The student view front end testing is under progress and the back end testing for login and authentication is also under progress. We intend to report some progress on the same by the next cycle.

## Overview:
 
We have succesfully ported the instructor and the student view to react. There have been tests implemented for the instructor view and the student view testing is in progress. The front end for the admin view has been created and the added functionality for the same is in progress. The student data validation feature has been implemeneted as there are two main users of the system, instructor and student. We can view the exam results as a student user as well as export the results as a CSV file too. There have been some test runs for the class management, and there is a added feature for the exam creation implemented into the system. As an overall view , there have been some design reworks and related implementations for enhancement and there have been some back end tests in order to verify the implemented features. We intend to work on the OMR and report some progress on the same by the next cycle. There is a motive to enhance the student UI using Shad cn, and there is a plan to tets the login and authentication as well. The creation of exams is still in progress.
