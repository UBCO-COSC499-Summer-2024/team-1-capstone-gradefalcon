### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

### Summary
This cycle saw significant progress across the team despite personal and academic challenges. Jusnoor completed the enhancement of the front end UI using ShadCN, optimized the user interface and usability, enhanced navigation and consistency, and improved dashboard functionality. Jusnoor also made strides in revamping the student dashboard and working on the five-point summary analysis for instructors. Bennett and Nelson successfully integrated Auth0 with the backend, refactoring API calls to ensure proper user authorization and permission checks. They also worked on storing user metadata on tokens and reading these tokens securely. Omar focused on refactoring the instructor pages using ShadCN, improving UI coherence and consistency, and completing the custom marking/evaluation feature. Ahmad added support for both 100 and 200 MCQ templates, integrated changes with the new UI, and ensured the bulk upload of files, while continuing to work on displaying results on the student view. The collective efforts have significantly strengthened the projectâ€™s foundation, with improved UI components, enhanced security through Auth0, and new functionalities being implemented and tested. Moving forward, the team aims to complete the remaining tasks, improve communication and collaboration, and ensure comprehensive test coverage.
